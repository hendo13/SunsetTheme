#### How Do I Install It?

Installation is pretty straightforward. After downloading your copy of Kirby, you'll want to download this theme as well. Download it (link: https://github.com/hendo13/SunsetTheme text: here), or if you're comfortable with the command line, feel free to clone it.

    $ git clone git@github.com:hendo13/SunsetTheme.git

In your fresh Kirby install, replace the **assets**, **content**, and **sites** directory with the ones in the **SunsetTheme** folder.

#### How Do I Include My Own Logo?

Replace the file **logo@2x.png** located in **assets/img** with your own logo. Now navigate to **site/snippets/header.php** and look around line 26. It should look something like this:
    
    <h1><a href="/"><img src="/assets/img/logo@2x.png" width="307" height="69" alt="<?=$site->title()?>"></a></h1>

Replace the value of the **src** attribute with your own image. If you want it retina-ready set the width and height to half the logo size. Usually that means making your logo twice as big as it's going to be displayed.

#### I Want To Change The Colours. Teach Me!

Well aren't you adventurous! I've made it fairly simple to change the colours by using SASS variables. Ok, here we go. Open up **assets/sass/screen.scss** and take a look at lines 4-11. You should see something that looks like this:

    /*--Colours--*/
    $bodybg: #f3f3f3;
    $containerbg: #f8f8f8;
    $bodytext: #444;
    $accent: #fb8b5f;
    $headerTopColour: #fc8a5f;
    $headerBottomColour: #fabd65;
    /*--End Colours--*/

You can go ahead and change the **values** of these variables. Please don't change the names, or bad things will happen. Now do a 'Select All' on the entire document and copy it to the clipboard. Now go to <http://c2c.briangonzalez.org> and paste the code in left pane and click Compile. It will spit out a bunch of code on the right. Select all that code, go back to your project, and open up **assets/stylesheets/screen.css** and paste in the code, and save it. Upon refresh, you should see your new colours. Whew.

#### Image Formatting

##### Header Image

Each blog post can have a header image - a full-width image that is at the top of a post. To include a header image, simply specify a **headerimage** field in your template file, or if you're the panel simply write a kirbytext link to the image. See the sample post "**The Sky Is The Limit**" for an example of using a header image.

##### Floated Images

Floating an image either left or write in your posts is super simple. Just add a **left** or **right** class to your kirbytext image tag. You can see an example on the sample **about** page

#### License

This theme is **free to use for personal or commercial projects**. However, please note the Kirby CMS is **not free**, and you must (link: https://sites.fastspring.com/openwe/instant/kirby text: buy a license) in order to use Kirby in a production environment.
